# Examples
- This folder contains the SQL queries used to test all the functions in the SqliteFuzzyPlusExtension, and it list the results.
- The results are based on the TestData.db file listed in the following link:https://github.com/David-Maisonave/SqliteFuzzyPlusExtension/tree/main/TestData
- **DB Browser for SQLite.exe** was used to test these queries, and the extension was connected by using option Tools->{Load Extension} option to load **"SqliteFuzzyPlusExtension.dll"** after copying **"FuzzyPlusCSharp.dll"** to the same folder containing **DB Browser for SQLite.exe**.
